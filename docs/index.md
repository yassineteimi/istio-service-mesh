# Exec Summary

## Introduction

Credit Mutuel is a large European bank that improved its capability to adopt AI during the Covid crisis, and integrated various AI models in production in order to reduce the workload on back office teams, facing a high level of loan requests. The added value was offloading manual and repetitive tasks, and letting human agents focusing on the business value, and taking complex decisions.

AIDC (AI Decision Coordination) is the new IBM product defining when and how AI should be involved in business process and how AI can be managed at scale in an Enterprise organisation.

AIDC empowers the Trustworthy AI framework, by offering new source of decisions, and performance metrics, in order to safely deploy AI in decisions processes, by avoiding cognitif bias and stay compliant to regulations.

## Context

In the context of signing a large contract deal, the client expects to see a stable and working version of the AI Decision Coordination solution. Given the fact that the development team didnâ€™t have the necessary skills, it was needed to prepare and deliver a deployment package on OpenShift for the upcoming GA release in a time-frame of six weeks.

IBM Client Engineering have worked in close collaboration with the AI Decision Coordination development team to cover each aspect of the solution packaging while passing on skills and knowledge to them at the same time.

The following are the project milestones that empowered the success of the AIDC lift and shift on Openshift:

* Framing & Understanding (1 week)
    * Definition of the MVP success factors
    * Confirmation of the MVP scope
    * Elaboration of project plan
    * Detailing of actions and assignments
* Design & Build (4 weeks)
    * Definition of the target architecture
    * Provisioning and configuration of the environment and the needed services
    * Automation of the deployment process
* Delivery & evaluation of the end-to-end automation (1 week)
    * Project documentation delivery
    * Evaluate the success factors
    * Pass the IBM internal security checks (penetration and performance tests ...)
    * Validate the project goals

## Goals

In a nuteshell, there are the main project goals:

* Ensure the product GOLIVE in time, in order to sign the deal.
* Design a viable architecture compatible with Credit Mutuel's security constraints and technical stack.
* Automate as much as possible the AIDC product installation.
